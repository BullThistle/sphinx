      3 => "With potent, flowery words speak I, Of something common, vulgar, dry; I weave webs of pedantic prose, In effort to befuddle those, Who think I wile time away, In lofty things, above all day The common kind that linger where Monadic beings live and fare; Practical I may not be, But life, it seems, is full of me!",
      4 => "Close to the words of life stay I, But I wither, wane, and grow dry.",

      6 => "I welcome the day with a show of light, I steathily came here in the night. I bathe the earthy stuff at dawn, But by the noon, alas! I'm gone.",
      7 => "Here there is no north, west, nor east, And weather fit for not man nor beast.",
      8 => "Large as a mountain, small as a pea, Endlessly swimming in a waterless sea. "
